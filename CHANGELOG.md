**Note:** The release notes for some Moq versions 4.6.*-alpha are still missing. They need to be
reconstructed from the commit history and the GitHub issue archive. If you would like to help make
this changelog more complete, any pull requests towards that goal are appreciated!

* Brand-new simplified event raising syntax (#130): `mock.Raise(foo => foo.MyEvent += null, new MyArgs(...));`
* Support for custom event signatures (not compatible with `EventHandler`): `mock.Raise(foo => foo.MyEvent += null, arg1, arg2, arg3);`
* Substantially improved property setter behavior: `mock.VerifySet(foo => foo.Value = "foo");` (also available for `SetupSet`
* Renamed `Expect*` with `Setup*`
* Vastly simplified custom argument matchers: `public int IsOdd() { return Match<int>.Create(v => i % 2 == 0); }`
* Added support for verifying how many times a member was invoked: `mock.Verify(foo => foo.Do(), Times.Never());`
* Added simple sample app named StoreSample
* Moved Stub functionality to the core API (`SetupProperty` and `SetupAllProperties`)
* Fixed sample ASP.NET MVC app to work with latest version
* Allow custom matchers to be created with a substantially simpler API
* Fixed issue #145 which prevented discrimination of setups by generic method argument types
* Fixed issue #141 which prevented ref arguments matching value types (i.e. a Guid)
* Implemented improvement #131: Add support for `It.IsAny` and custom argument matchers for `SetupSet`/`VerifySet`
* Implemented improvement #124 to render better error messages
* Applied patch from David Kirkland for improvement #125 to improve matching of enumerable parameters
* Implemented improvement #122 to provide custom errors for `Verify`
* Implemented improvement #121 to provide `null` as default value for `Nullable<T>`
* Fixed issue #112 which fixes passing a null argument to a mock constructor
* Implemented improvement #111 to better support params arguments
* Fixed bug #105 about improperly overwriting setups for property getter and setter
* Applied patch from Ihar.Bury for issue #99 related to protected expectations 
* Fixed issue #97 on not being able to use `SetupSet`/`VerifySet` if property did not have a getter
* Better integration with Pex (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/Pex/)
* Various other minor fixes (#134, #135, #137, #138, #140, etc.)

## 2.6

* Implemented Issue #55: We now provide a `mock.DefaultValue` = [`DefaultValue.Empty` | `DefaultValue.Mock`] which will provide the current behavior (default) or mocks for mockeable return types for loose mock invocations without expectations.
* Added support for stubbing properties from moq-contrib: now you can do `mock.Stub(m => m.Value)` and add stub behavior to the property. `mock.StubAll()` is also provided. This integrates with the `DefaultValue` behavior too, so you can stub entire hierarchies :).
* Added support for mocking methods with `out` and `ref` parameters (Issue #50)
* Applied patch contributed by slava for Issue #72: add support to limit numbor of calls on mocked method (we now have `mock.Expect(...).AtMost(5)`)
* Implemented Issue #94: Easier setter verification: Now we support `ExpectSet(m = m.Value, "foo")` and `VerifySet(m = m.Value, 5)` (Thanks ASP.NET MVC Team!)
* Implemented issue #96: Automatically chain mocks when setting expectations. It's now possible to specify expectations for an entire hierarchy of objects just starting from the root mock. THIS IS REALLY COOL!!!
* Fixed Issue #89: `Expects()` does not always return last expectation
* Implemented Issue 91: Expect a method/property to never be called (added `Never()` method to an expectation. Can be used on methods, property getters and setters)
* Fixed Issue 86: `IsAny<T>` should check if the value is actually of type `T`
* Fixed Issue 88: Cannot mock protected internal virtual methods using `Moq.Protected`
* Fixed Issue 90: Removing event handlers from mocked objects
* Updated demo and added one more test for the dynamic addition of interfaces

## 2.5

* Added support for mocking protected members
* Added new way of extending argument matchers which is now very straightforward
* Added support for mocking events
* Added support for firing events from expectations
* Removed usage of MBROs which caused inconsistencies in mocking features
* Added `ExpectGet` and `ExpectSet` to better support properties, and provide better intellisense.
* Added verification with expressions, which better supports Arrange-Act-Assert testing model (can do `Verify(m => m.Do(...)))`
* Added `Throws<TException>`
* Added `mock.CallBase` property to specify whether the virtual members base implementation should be called
* Added support for implementing and setting expectations and verifying additional interfaces in the mock, via the new `mock.As<TInterface>()` method (thanks Fernando Simonazzi!)
* Improved argument type matching for `Is`/`IsAny` (thanks Jeremy.Skinner!)

## 2.0

* Refactored fluent API on mocks. This may cause some existing tests to fail, but the fix is trivial (just reorder the calls to `Callback`, `Returns` and `Verifiable`)
* Added support for retrieving a `Mock<T>` from a `T` instance created by a mock.
* Added support for retrieving the invocation arguments from a `Callback` or `Returns`.
* Implemented `AtMostOnce()` constraint 
* Added support for creating MBROs with protected constructors
* Loose mocks now return default empty arrays and `IEnumerables` instead of `null`s

## 1.5.1

* Refactored `MockFactory` to make it simpler and more explicit to use with regards to verification. Thanks Garry Shutler for the feedback! 

## 1.5

* Added `MockFactory` to allow easy construction of multiple mocks with the same behavior and verification 

## 1.4

* Added support for passing constructor arguments for mocked classes.
* Improved code documentation 

## 1.3

 * Added support for overriding expectations set previously on a Mock. Now adding a second expectation for the same method/property call will override the existing one. This facilitates setting up default expectations in a fixture setup and overriding when necessary in a specific test.
 * Added support for mock verification. Both `Verify` and `VerifyAll` are provided for more flexibility (the former only verifies methods marked `Verifiable`) 

## 1.2

* Added support for `MockBehavior` mock constructor argument to affect the way the mocks expect or throw on calls. 

## 1.1

* Merged branch for dynamic types. Now Moq is based on Castle DynamicProxy2 to support a wider range of mock targets.
* Added ILMerge so that Castle libraries are merged into Moq assembly (no need for external references and avoid conflicts)

## 1.0

* Initial release, initial documentation process in place, etc.
